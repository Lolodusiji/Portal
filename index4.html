                <h3>Equipping young people with a brighter future</h3>
                <p>At Pauds Children’s Services (formerly known as Priory Education and Children’s Services), we always see potential and dedicate ourselves to delivering positive change for children. We support young people to achieve their aspirations, no matter what their challenges may be. We believe that every young person deserves the right care, support and education that equips them for a brighter future.<br><br>

                    Wherever a child’s potential lies, we commit ourselves to being the difference, which helps them to achieve their goals. Our specialist schools, colleges, children’s homes and fostering agency provide the highest standards of support to children with a range of needs. With an unwavering focus on achieving the very best outcomes, we empower young people to fulfil their own unique potential.<br><br>
                    
                    Across the Pauds services, children grow, develop and progress. They engage with learning and achieve academically, while developing emotionally and socially. With the dedicated support and expertise from our staff teams, young people build the self-esteem and independence to move forward to the next stage of their life with confidence.<br><br>
                    
                    Whether we are working with young people with autism, learning difficulties, social, emotional and mental health (SEMH) difficulties or supporting some of society’s most vulnerable children, we are committed to helping each child to achieve their unique goals and aspirations.</p>
